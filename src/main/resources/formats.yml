# list of all chat formats
chat:
  # the handle of the chat format (what it is called in the code & what it is referenced by)
  default:
    # if this is higher than other formats and the player has permission for multiple, this one will be shown
    priority: 999
    # The permission node for the player to use
    permission: "space.chat.cf.default"

    # the format itself; it contains parts that make up the chat format

      # these names are ambiguous. make them whatever you want and however many you want!

            # <- open a url; the options are: "open_url", "run_command", "suggest_command" - self explanatory
            action: "open_url"
            # this is the value used. if open_url, this is the open url....etc

          # when someone hovers
          hover:
