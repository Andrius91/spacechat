# list of all chat formats
chat:
  # the handle of the chat format (what it is called in the code & what it is referenced by)
  default:
    # if this is higher than other formats and the player has permission for multiple, this one will be shown
    priority: 1
    # The permission node for the player to use
    permission: "space.chat.cf.default"

    # the format itself; it contains parts that make up the chat format
    format:
      # these names are ambiguous. make them whatever you want and however many you want!
      prefix:
        # the text shown (Can't use MiniMessage parsing for this!)
        text: "&(#34eb96)Default &8| "

        # interaction events. right now you can do something on "click", or when someone "hovers"
        extra:
          # on click event
          click:
            # <- open a url; the options are: "open_url", "run_command", "suggest_command", "change_page", "open_file", etc - self explanatory
            action: "open_url"
            # this is the value used. if open_url, this is the open url....etc
            value: "https://tebex.io"

          # when someone hovers
          hover:
            lines:
              # these are the lines shown when someone hovers over the message
              - "&bCLICK ME"
